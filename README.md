Hey welcome
Before starting i would like to state why i wrote this code. Basically, I got the motivation when I was watching 'Financial Markets' course on coursera I noticed a lack of open-source projects applying this specific academic framework to cryptocurrency markets.
How to Run : Install dependencies:  pip install pandas matplotlib scipy requests
Conclusion: The result shows that eth and btc are correlated as the line is straight so it is also a kind of 'proof'
The beta is 0.46 which shows btc is a safer investment than etherium but etherium can give more returns than btc (with more depression)
