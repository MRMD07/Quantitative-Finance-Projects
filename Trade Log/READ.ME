A Python based tool that lets users log their cryptocurrency or stock trades and automatically calculates the total volume traded. It makes use of immutable data structure (Tuple) to ensure trade record and integrity.

How it Works:

Input: The user specifies how many trades they want to enter.

Processing: The script collects the Pair, Direction (Buy/Sell), Price, and Amount for each trade.

Storage: Trades are saved as tuples inside a list to keep the data structured and safe.

Output: The program calculates the total dollar volume of all trades in the list.
